# Team39
We build a web application using Python, Flask, and mySQL.
In order to run our app, the first thing you need to do is to change the content of db.yaml file.
This file is located at app/static/db.yaml. You need to change the value of MYSQL_PASSWORD
and MYSQL_DB according to your own machine. And then, through command line, just go to the
target direction and run the run.py file.
